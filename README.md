# Hospitaller

## üè• Project Vision
In this ongoing pandemic, Doctors and medical responders need powerful tools to coordinate and organize their efforts. 


This is Hospitaller. It is designed to deploy to a hospital or emergency  medical facility and help the doctors and first responders know the status‚Äô of their patients, what equipment and resources they have available, and give them the ability to update that information quickly as they work to save lives.

## üè• Web Application

The web application consists of a frontend written in Razor views, HTML, CSS and
Bootstrap. The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.

The homepage displays the apps logo and allows the user to go to either the Patients or About Us pages. On the Patients page the user will see a list off all patients (brought from the backend and our database) and allow the user to either edit or add entries.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Team-Forky/HospitalFrontEnd
```
Once downloaded, you can either use the dotnet CLI utilities or Visual Studio 2017 (or greater) to build the web application. The solution file is located in the /HospitalProjectFrontEnd subdirectory at the root of the repository.
```
cd YourRepo/YourProject
dotnet build
```
The dotnet tools will automatically restore any NuGet dependencies. Before running the application, the provided code-first migration will need to be applied to the SQL server of your choice configured in your user secrets file. This requires the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools NuGet package and can be run from the NuGet Package Manager Console:
```
Update-Database
```
Once the database has been created, the application can be run. Options for running and debugging the application using IIS Express or Kestrel are provided within Visual Studio. From the command line, the following will start an instance of the Kestrel server to host the application:
```
cd HospitalFrontEnd/HospitalProjectFrontEnd
dotnet run
```
